### Generate Tasks

Create a JSON list of tasks the business owner should action within the next 30 days. Provide just the JSON with no markdown.

Use the following template:

```json
{
  "title": "",
  "description": "",
  "category": "(personal, general, products-or-services, structure, financial, human-resources, operations, sales-marketing, customers, technology, future-proofing, legal-licensing)",
  "priority": "(low, medium, high, critical)"
}
```

The description should be detailed with any necessary step-by-step instructions.
