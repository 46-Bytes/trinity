align offerings to grant criteria.  \n- Without robust procedures and a support structure, rapid expansion can create serious operational headaches.  \n- Building deeper school contacts and decision-maker relationships is crucial to break into multiple districts.  \n- A clear marketing strategy and documented processes will transform ad-hoc growth into sustainable scale.  \n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n- Tap into state and federal anti-bullying funding: craft grant-ready proposals and partnerships with education departments.  \n- Scale delivery through online modules or webinars: capture new markets and generate passive income streams.  \n- Partner with allied coaches for co-facilitated workshops: expand capacity and geographic reach while sharing resources.  \n- Develop a branded programme package for schools: set competitive pricing, offer tiered service levels and annual contracts.  \n- Create a referral network within existing client schools: leverage success stories to secure introductory pilot programmes.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Educational services\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Laura McIntosh \",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"laura@steppingintoyourpower.com.au\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0414213099\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"Director\",\n    \"Business Details - Please complete this table for each involved entity\": [\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"Stepping Into Your Power Pty Ltd\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"Stepping Into Your Power \",\n            \"abn\": \"28264482846\",\n            \"directors\": \"Laura Maree McIntosh \"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Headquarter Business Address\": \"7 Oakland Court, King Scrub QLD 4521\",\n    \"Business Email\": \"laura@steppingintoyourpower.com.au\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"0414213099\",\n    \"Business Website(s)\": \"www.steppingintoyourpower.com.au\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"Holland Price & Associates\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"Scott Price \",\n    \"Accountant Address\": \"15 Roderick Street, Dayboro QLD 4521\",\n    \"Accountant Phone\": \"0447384179\",\n    \"Accountant Email\": \"price@hpaccountants.com.au\",\n    \"Why is the business for sale?\": \"N\\/A\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"We work on people\'s mindset and overcome any blocks or unresouceful beliefs \",\n    \"Did you start the business?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How old is the business?\": 4,\n    \"What was your turnover last financial year?\": \"Under $250,000\",\n    \"What do you intend to do after selling the business?\": [\n        {\n            \"sellerName\": \"N\\/A\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"What is the business structure?\": \"Trading under a family trust: McPower Trust\",\n    \"How many shareholders are there?\": \"1\",\n    \"How many directors are there in total?\": \"1\",\n    \"Does your business require any licences in order to operate?\": \"No\",\n    \"Is your business currently facing any legal actions?\": \"No\",\n    \"Are there any regulations that your business must comply with?\": \"No\",\n    \"How many locations does your business operate out of?\": \"1-10\",\n    \"Does the business own any properties?\": \"No\",\n    \"How many properties does the business lease?\": \"none\",\n    \"Do any of the properties (owned or leased) require any form of upgrade in the next 12 months (eg.

Executive summary</h3>\n  <p>\n    Stepping Into Your Power Pty Ltd, led by Laura McIntosh, demonstrates strong compliance in tax (M7) and solid brand integrity (M6). However, critical deficiencies in due diligence preparation (M8), people and HR policies (M4), and owner dependency and operations (M3) pose significant sale-readiness risks. Amber-rated modules—customer/product quality (M5), legal compliance (M2) and financial reporting (M1)—also require targeted enhancements. Immediate focus on red modules will establish robust foundations, reduce risk and position the business for scalable growth and a successful exit.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>2.

Build a lean in-house sales team and formalise a sales-and-marketing strategy to lift new-customer sales.  \n2. Implement a CRM platform, segment customers and establish KPI dashboards to track ROI.  \n3. Document core workflows (development support, hosting, client onboarding) and introduce HR policies.  \n4. Recruit key staff to share operational load, mitigate retention risk and reduce founder hours.\n\n**Key Takeaways**  \n• Repeat business is exceptional (99% repeat rate; 45% revenue from top three clients) – nurture it while pursuing growth.  \n• Margins sit at industry average; pricing hasn’t been reviewed in over a year—an opportunity for uplift.  \n• Forward orders are low ($550 total), underlining the need for a stronger pipeline.  \n• Recent process reengineering lays the groundwork for full documentation and automation.  \n• Business can run without James—ideal timing to delegate, empower and train.\n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n• Leverage existing tech stack (Make.com, Zapier, Plesk) to automate support and billing.  \n• Launch targeted digital marketing (LinkedIn, SEO) within current budget to attract SMEs.  \n• Introduce tiered service contracts or retainer models to stabilise revenue and improve margins.  \n• Formalise pricing reviews and margin analysis to carve out premium positioning.  \n• Develop a clear succession roadmap to secure value and ensure continuity.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Technical services\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"James Ussery\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"james@ussery.me\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"9714533225\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"CEO\",\n    \"Business Details - Please complete this table for each involved entity\": [\n        {\n            \"abn\": \"1234234234\",\n            \"companyName\": \"Machus Corporation\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"Machus\",\n            \"directors\": \"James Ussery, Farrah Macchiwalla\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Headquarter Business Address\": \"106 N Denton Tap Rd ste 210-114 Coppell, Texas, 75019\",\n    \"Please list all other office\\/location addresses\": [\n        {\n            \"addresses\": \"200 Greenridge Dr apt 904 Lake Oswego, Oregon 97035\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Business Email\": \"james@mach.us\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"2147718424\",\n    \"Business Website(s)\": \"https:\\/\\/mach.us\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"Jungle Books\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"Chakra Shamnani\",\n    \"Accountant Address\": \"16775 Addison Rd., Ste 480 Addison, Texas 75001\",\n    \"Accountant Phone\": \"214- 484-7701\",\n    \"Accountant Email\": \"chakra@junglebooks.net\",\n    \"Why is the business for sale?\": \"Retirement\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"Web and Mobile application development including Ai, hosting and ongoing service maintenance\",\n    \"Did you start the business?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How old is the business?\": 19,\n    \"What was your turnover last financial year?\": \"Under $250,000\",\n    \"What is the business structure?\": \"US based S Corp\",\n    \"How many shareholders are there?\": \"2\",\n    \"How many directors are there in total?\": \"2\",\n    \"Does your business require any licences in order to operate?\": \"No\",\n    \"Is your business currently facing any legal actions?\": \"No\",\n    \"Are there any regulations that your business must comply with?\": \"No\",\n    \"How many locations does your business operate out of?\": \"1-10\",\n    \"Does the business own any properties?\": \"No\",\n    \"How many properties does the business lease?\": \"none\",\n    \"Do any of the properties (owned or leased) require any form of upgrade in the next 12 months (eg.

no delegation, no documented processes, business cannot run without him.  \n- Weak governance and reporting: no management or team meetings, no operational reports reviewed, sporadic debt repayments on a $1.2 million machinery loan.  \n- HR and culture risks: no HR policies or performance reviews, retention threats flagged, underperforming staff not formally managed.  \n- Sales and marketing absence: no CRM, no sales process, zero marketing budget, no online presence—leaving growth unrealised.\n\n**High-Level Goals**  \n- Implement rigorous financial controls and compliance mechanisms: appoint a bookkeeper, update tax returns, ensure licence compliance.  \n- Reduce owner risk through succession planning and delegation: develop deputy roles, document duties, and institute divisional management meetings.  \n- Optimise operations via process documentation and technology: map workflows, invest in basic automation tools, establish regular management reporting.  \n- Launch a targeted sales and marketing strategy: build a simple website/e-commerce platform, segment customers, allocate a modest marketing budget and track ROI.\n\n**Key Takeaways**  \n- Over-reliance on a single leader is a business vulnerability; delegation and clear processes are non-negotiable.  \n- Consistent financial review and professional support safeguard against compliance lapses and unexpected liabilities.  \n- A basic digital toolkit—even email plus CRM—can transform coordination, customer insight and growth.  \n- Failing to market equates to leaving revenue on the table; even minimal investment yields learnings.  \n- HR frameworks and regular performance discussions drive team cohesion and protect institutional knowledge.\n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n- Establish an e-commerce channel to capture online sales and broaden market reach.  \n- Introduce basic ERP or cloud-based operations software to streamline production, inventory and reporting.  \n- Create a concise product-pricing review to align with market rates and boost margins.  \n- Formalise a simple CRM to nurture repeat business and track customer lifetime value.  \n- Build a phased succession plan to facilitate exit strategy and ensure continuity.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Manufacturing and associated industries\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Stanley Smith\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"stanley@stanley.com\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0400000000\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"Owner\",\n    \"Business Details - Please complete this table for each involved entity\": [\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"SMH Pty Ltd\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"Stanley\",\n            \"abn\": \"153486\",\n            \"directors\": \"Stanley Smith, John Washington\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Please list all other office\\/location addresses\": [\n        {\n            \"addresses\": \"8 Gregsue Ct, The Gap, 4061\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"addresses\": \"11 Mary Street, Sydney, NSW 2000\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Business Email\": \"admin@manuco.com.au\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"1300236456\",\n    \"Business Website(s)\": \"www.manuco.com.au\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"Forsyths\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"Bob Hope\",\n    \"Accountant Address\": \"3 Fosyths Street, Roma, QLD\",\n    \"Accountant Phone\": \"1200500500\",\n    \"Accountant Email\": \"bob@accountant.com\",\n    \"Why is the business for sale?\": \"Time to exit\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"We manufacture cups and mugs\",\n    \"Did you start the business?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How old is the business?\": 20,\n    \"What was your turnover last financial year?\": \"$5,000,001 - $10,000,000\",\n    \"What do you intend to do after selling the business?\": [\n        {\n            \"sellerName\": \"Stanley\",\n            \"sellerIntent\": \"Not quite sure yet\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"What is the business structure?\": \"Company owned by another company\",\n    \"How many shareholders are there?\": \"6\",\n    \"How many directors are there in total?\": \"4\",\n    \"Does your business require any licences in order to operate?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"Please complete this table\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"Manufacturers licence\",\n            \"expiry\": \"17th July 2025\",\n            \"cost\": \"$4500\",\n            \"date\": \"14th May 2025\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Are your licences up to date?\": \"No\",\n    \"Is your business currently facing any legal actions?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"Are there any regulations that your business must comply with?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"Please advise\": \"We have the food standards to abide by.\",\n    \"How many locations does your business operate out of?\": \"1-10\",\n    \"Does the business own any properties?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How many properties does the business lease?\": \"none\",\n    \"Do any of the properties (owned or leased) require any form of upgrade in the next 12 months (eg.

Executive summary</h2>\n<p>Stanley’s manufacturing business demonstrates solid financial clarity and property compliance but is hindered by critical gaps in brand identity, digital presence and strategic planning. Operations remain heavily owner-dependent, with no documented processes or succession plans, while HR and CRM frameworks are underdeveloped. Outstanding business tax returns and legal actions further diminish sale-readiness. Priorities include brand and website enhancement, drafting a strategic business plan, mapping operational processes and establishing core HR and CRM systems.</p>\n\n<h2>2.

Executive Summary</h2>\n    <p>\n      Toby Flanders’s premium coffee-bean roasting business demonstrates strong tax compliance (Module 7) and solid financial management (Module 1), underpinned by a cohesive team and sound HR policies (Module 4). The brand and digital assets are in place, but updates are overdue (Module 6). Key gaps are evident in legal documentation and property compliance (Module 2) and in customer, product and revenue quality measures (Module 5). Owner dependency and lack of documented processes (Module 3), absence of a strategic business plan (Module 8) and limited marketing infrastructure further impede sale readiness. Addressing these issues through targeted tasks will enhance buyer confidence and streamline the exit process.\n    </p>\n\n    <!-- Section 2 -->\n    <h2>2.

top three customers contribute just 18% of revenue, minimising concentration risk.  \n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n- US expansion via social commerce and direct-to-consumer channels to capture growing mineral sunscreen demand.  \n- Launch SPF-focused skincare range leveraging existing GMP licences and R&D capacity.  \n- Build out affiliate and influencer programmes to drive incremental D2C sales.  \n- Secure long-term supply agreements to mitigate commodity volatility and safeguard margins.  \n- Enhance CRM-driven loyalty schemes and subscription models to further increase repeat-purchase frequency.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Manufacturing and associated industries\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Sarah Chen\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"sarahchen@purepath.com.au\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0400123445\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"CEO\",\n    \"Business Details - Please complete this table for each involved entity\": [\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"Pure Path Organics PTY LTD\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"Pure Path Organics\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Headquarter Business Address\": \"18\\/54 Harvest Rd Brookvale NSW 2100\",\n    \"Please list all other office\\/location addresses\": [\n        {\n            \"addresses\": \"Westfield Bondi Junction\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"addresses\": \"Chadstone Vic\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Business Email\": \"info@purepathorganics.com.au\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"1300 787367\",\n    \"Business Website(s)\": \"www.purepathorganics.com.au\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"Grant-Lee & Co\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"Anthony Albanese\",\n    \"Accountant Address\": \"22 parliament Drive Canberra\",\n    \"Accountant Phone\": \"0404222333\",\n    \"Accountant Email\": \"ihavenoidea@FedGov.com.au\",\n    \"Why is the business for sale?\": \"Shareholders plan to list for sale within 12 months\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"Manufature and sell organic skin care and cosmetis.

recruitment and retention remain moderate challenges.  \n  • ESG reporting underway for 2025 – leverage sustainability credentials in sales and investor communications.  \n\n- **Top Opportunities**  \n  • US market expansion via social commerce partnerships and dedicated distribution channels.  \n  • New SPF/mineral sunscreen line to meet growing consumer demand and packaging regulations.  \n  • Affiliate marketing and private-label partnerships to broaden revenue streams.  \n  • Supplier diversification to mitigate shea-butter volatility and freight-cost rises.  \n  • Enhanced utilisation of CRM data to segment customers further and boost repeat sales (78% repeat rate).','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Manufacturing and associated industries\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Sarah Chen\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"sarah@purepathorganics.com.au\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0400 000 000\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"Chief Executive Officer\",\n    \"Business Details - Please complete this table for each involved entity\": [\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"Pure Path Organics Pty Ltd\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"PurePathOrganics\",\n            \"abn\": \"97 613 782 115\",\n            \"directors\": \"Sarah Chen, Liam Patel, Jacinta Reeve\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Headquarter Business Address\": \"18\\/54 Harvest Road Brookvale NSW 2100\",\n    \"Please list all other office\\/location addresses\": [\n        {\n            \"addresses\": \"Pop up kiosk Westfield Bondi Junction\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"addresses\": \"Pop up Westfield Chadstone\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Business Email\": \"info@purepathorganics.com.au\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"1300 787 367\",\n    \"Business Website(s)\": \"purepathorganics.com.au\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"Grant-Lee & Co\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"Tracey Vinn\",\n    \"Accountant Address\": \"Unit 3, 67 Boundary Road Brookvale NSW 2100\",\n    \"Accountant Phone\": \"02 5678 4523\",\n    \"Accountant Email\": \"tracey@grant-lee&co\",\n    \"Why is the business for sale?\": \"Shareholders plan to list for sale within 12 months to realise value\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"Manufactures and sells certified organic skincare\\/cosmetics via D2c, wholesale and export\",\n    \"Did you start the business?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How old is the business?\": 10,\n    \"What was your turnover last financial year?\": \"$5,000,001 - $10,000,000\",\n    \"What do you intend to do after selling the business?\": [\n        {\n            \"sellerName\": \"Sarah Chen\",\n            \"sellerIntent\": \"Looking for new opportunities\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"sellerName\": \"Liam Patel\",\n            \"sellerIntent\": \"Work on existing investments\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"sellerName\": \"Jacinta Reeve\",\n            \"sellerIntent\": \"Focus on future opportunities\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"What is the business structure?\": \"Company\",\n    \"How many shareholders are there?\": \"3\",\n    \"How many directors are there in total?\": \"3\",\n    \"Does your business require any licences in order to operate?\": \"No\",\n    \"Is your business currently facing any legal actions?\": \"No\",\n    \"Are there any regulations that your business must comply with?\": \"No\",\n    \"How many locations does your business operate out of?\": \"1-10\",\n    \"Does the business own any properties?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How many properties does the business lease?\": \"none\",\n    \"Do any of the properties (owned or leased) require any form of upgrade in the next 12 months (eg.

accountant engagement only annually.  \n- Cost pressures and competition: Rising aluminium prices and cheaper Asian imports erode margins.  \n- Process and reporting shortcomings: Key processes undocumented, no operational report reviews, low tech-integration effectiveness.  \n- HR and culture challenges: No formal policies or regular team meetings, recruitment and retention under threat, poor team cohesion.  \n\n**High-Level Goals**  \n- Develop and implement a formal succession and continuity plan to reduce founder dependency.  \n- Bring all financial statements and BAS returns up to date; increase accountant interaction to quarterly.  \n- Establish robust cost-control measures, diversify supplier base and hedge aluminium price risk.  \n- Document core processes, introduce operational reporting cadence and enhance automation tools.  \n\n**Key Takeaways**  \n- Strong profitability ($1–2 million) but vulnerable to raw-material costs and overseas competition.  \n- Online channel underexploited (10% of sales); potential for significant digital growth.  \n- Marketing spend ($50k–$100k) yields unclear ROI; lack of data tracking hinders decision-making.  \n- Substantial WIP and stock carry balance sheet risk; tighten working-capital controls.  \n- CRM exists but scores 2/10; customer-data utilisation is minimal.  \n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n- Expand into export markets to capitalise on global demand and diversify revenues.  \n- Grow e-commerce presence and explore third-party marketplaces to boost online sales.  \n- Upgrade CRM and implement a structured sales process, including segmentation and ROI tracking.  \n- Formalise HR framework: introduce policies, performance reviews, and regular team meetings.  \n- Optimise process documentation and leverage automation to improve efficiency and scalability.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Manufacturing and associated industries\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Alan Turner\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"Alan@gol.com.au\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0418 822 228\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"Founder and MD\",\n    \"Business Details - Please complete this table for each involved entity\": [\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"Greenside Outdoor Living Pty Ltd\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"Greenside Furniture\",\n            \"abn\": \"58 624 317 902\",\n            \"directors\": \"Alan Turner\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"directors\": \"Kate Turner\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Headquarter Business Address\": \"21\\/33 Commerce Drive Yatala Qld 4207\",\n    \"Business Email\": \"info@gol.com.au\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"7077 6066\",\n    \"Business Website(s)\": \"www.gol.com.au\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"Yearn & Co\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"F Yearn\",\n    \"Accountant Address\": \"22\\/33 Commerce Drive Yatala Qld\",\n    \"Accountant Phone\": \"7777 6666\",\n    \"Accountant Email\": \"yearn@gmail.com.au\",\n    \"Why is the business for sale?\": \"Founders are looking to retire\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"Designs and Manufactures premium aluminium and Timber outdoor furniture\",\n    \"Did you start the business?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"What was your turnover last financial year?\": \"$10,000,001+\",\n    \"What do you intend to do after selling the business?\": [\n        {\n            \"sellerName\": \"Alan Turner\",\n            \"sellerIntent\": \"Retire and Travel\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"sellerName\": \"Kate Turner\",\n            \"sellerIntent\": \"Retire and Travel\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"What is the business structure?\": \"Pty Ltd company\",\n    \"How many shareholders are there?\": \"2\",\n    \"How many directors are there in total?\": \"2\",\n    \"Does your business require any licences in order to operate?\": \"No\",\n    \"Is your business currently facing any legal actions?\": \"No\",\n    \"Are there any regulations that your business must comply with?\": \"No\",\n    \"How many locations does your business operate out of?\": \"1-10\",\n    \"Does the business own any properties?\": \"No\",\n    \"How many properties does the business lease?\": \"1\",\n    \"Please complete this for PROPERTY 1\": {\n        \"business_property_address\": \"21\\/33 Commerce drive Yatala qld\",\n        \"premise_type\": \"Factory Warehouse3 years remaining\",\n        \"lease_terms\": \"3 Years remaining\",\n        \"options\": \"1x3 years\",\n        \"current_term_expiry_date\": \"30\\/9\\/27\",\n        \"rent\": \"$29,800 +GST per Month\",\n        \"rent_include_outgoings\": \"Plus Outgoings\",\n        \"rent_review_method\": \"CPI\",\n        \"next_review_date\": \"October 25\",\n        \"council_rates_per_quarter\": \"1000\",\n        \"water_rates_per_quarter\": \"1000\",\n        \"body_corporate_per_quarter\": \"1000\",\n        \"property_ownership_entity_name\": \"N\\/a\",\n        \"real_property_description\": \"Factory\\/Warehouse\",\n        \"strata_or_torrens_title\": \"Strata\",\n        \"annual_rates\": \"10,000\",\n        \"annual_corporate_fees\": \"2000\",\n        \"zoning\": \"Industrial\",\n        \"land_area\": \"2500sq mtres\",\n        \"construction_type\": \"Brick\",\n        \"estimated_age_of_building\": \"10 years\",\n        \"number_of_parking_spaces\": \"35\",\n        \"proposed_annual_rental\": \"N\\/a\"\n    },\n    \"Do any of the properties (owned or leased) require any form of upgrade in the next 12 months (eg.

Executive Summary</h2>\n    <p>Greenside Furniture is a $10 million+ outdoor furniture manufacturer with strong revenue and founder expertise, but key gaps exist in tax compliance, legal documentation, owner dependency, HR frameworks and customer/product processes. Activity statements and tax returns are overdue, no bookkeeper is appointed, and strategic planning and due-diligence materials are incomplete. HR policies, performance reviews and documented processes require urgent attention to reduce owner dependency and improve team cohesion. Sales, marketing and branding processes are underdeveloped, and a formal data-room structure is needed for a smooth exit.</p>\n    <p>This roadmap prioritises eight Sale-Ready modules by gap severity and provides a clear sequence of tasks—starting with lodging outstanding tax returns and collecting legal-structure documents, through to preparing a secure data-room and formalising HR and operational procedures—to drive rapid improvements in sale readiness.</p>\n\n    <h2>2.

Executive Summary</h2>\n  <p>Manuco’s performance has declined since acquisition, with financial reporting infrequent, critical licences out of date, overdue activity statements and high owner dependency. Operational and HR processes lack consistency, and customer, product and marketing systems are under-utilised. Brand assets are strong online but physical premises need refreshing. A structured programme addressing legal compliance, customer and revenue quality, operational resilience, tax compliance, financial clarity, people management, due diligence readiness and brand consistency will greatly enhance sale readiness.</p>\n\n  <h2>2.

supplement with external advisory for growth and exit planning.  \n- Profitability track record (net profit A$500k–1 million) makes the business an attractive proposition—document and communicate this consistently.  \n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n- Launch an e-commerce platform and explore third-party marketplaces to capture new customer segments.  \n- Optimise the CRM system: integrate sales analytics, automate follow-ups and refine customer-journey mapping.  \n- Engage a business-process consultant to map current workflows and implement lean methodologies.  \n- Invest in team-building and leadership coaching to convert weekly reviews into genuine staff engagement.  \n- Leverage tech support rating of 10/10 to pilot advanced ERP or inventory-management solutions for scale.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Banking, finance and insurance industry\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Morgan Stanley\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"pspinda+morgan@gmail.com\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0456895487\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"Owner\",\n    \"Business Details - Please complete this table for each involved entity\": [\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"SMH Pty Ltd\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"Manuco\",\n            \"abn\": \"659884\",\n            \"directors\": \"Morgan STanley\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"HMY Pty Ltd\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"Morgan Stanley\",\n            \"abn\": \"1567869\",\n            \"directors\": \"Morgan STanley\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Headquarter Business Address\": \"Unit 13, 23 square street, The Gap, QLD 4061\",\n    \"Please list all other office\\/location addresses\": [\n        {\n            \"addresses\": \"8 Gregsue Ct, The Gap, 4061\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"addresses\": \"11 Mary Street, Sydney, NSW 2000\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Business Email\": \"admin@manuco.com.au\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"1300236456\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"Forsyths\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"Bob Hope\",\n    \"Accountant Address\": \"3 Fosyths Street, Roma, QLD\",\n    \"Accountant Phone\": \"1200500500\",\n    \"Why is the business for sale?\": \"Time to exit\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"We manufacture roofing products\",\n    \"Did you start the business?\": \"No\",\n    \"How did you acquire the business?\": \"Purchased\",\n    \"How many years have you had this business?\": 12,\n    \"How old is the business?\": 51,\n    \"What was your turnover last financial year?\": \"$5,000,001 - $10,000,000\",\n    \"What do you intend to do after selling the business?\": [\n        {\n            \"sellerName\": \"Morgan Stanley\",\n            \"sellerIntent\": \"Retire\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Is your business currently facing any legal actions?\": \"No\",\n    \"Are there any regulations that your business must comply with?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"Please advise\": \"Banking industry\",\n    \"How many locations does your business operate out of?\": \"11-20\",\n    \"Does the business own any properties?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How many properties does the business lease?\": \"10\",\n    \"Do any of the properties (owned or leased) require any form of upgrade in the next 12 months (eg.

Executive summary</h3>\n<p>\nMorgan Stanley demonstrates robust financial performance, consistent tax compliance and strong people practices. The primary risk area is legal compliance and property management due to outdated licences and lease oversight. Technology integration and team cohesion offer opportunities for optimisation, while customer management, brand assets and due diligence readiness are sound but can be further refined. \n</p>\n\n<h3>2.

Restore profitability and stabilise cash flow by reducing debt reliance, optimising working capital and streamlining top three expenses (contractors, casuals, permanent staff).  \n2. Achieve full regulatory and licence compliance, complete required property and premises upgrades, and standardise compliance monitoring schedules.  \n3. Build organisational resilience: formalise and implement a robust succession plan, document core processes and delegate critical duties to reduce owner dependency.  \n4. Develop and execute a targeted sales and marketing strategy: implement a clear sales process, upgrade the CRM, track ROI and diversify the customer base beyond top three clients.\n\n**Key Takeaways**  \n- Document and standardise core processes now to enable smoother handovers and reduce business reliance on any single individual.  \n- Institute proactive licence-renewal and property-maintenance calendars to avoid non-compliance penalties.  \n- Introduce regular performance reviews and staff development programmes to improve culture, engagement and retention.  \n- Move from quarterly to monthly financial and operational reporting to detect issues early and drive timely corrective actions.  \n- Track marketing spend ROI and adjust channels based on data insights, rather than anecdotal demand.\n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n- Digital marketing overhaul: invest in online lead generation, content marketing and e-commerce capabilities to reach new customers.  \n- Product and market diversification: leverage emerging technologies and materials to expand beyond current roofing products.  \n- CRM and ERP enhancements: deepen automation, improve customer-data utilisation and strengthen sales pipeline visibility.  \n- Talent development initiatives: upskill existing staff, recruit strategically to fill gaps and boost team culture.  \n- Leverage manufacturing expertise: position as a premium supplier, increase margins through value-added services and bespoke solutions.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Manufacturing and associated industries\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Stacey Meghins\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"stacey@manuco.com.au\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0456895487\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"Owner\",\n    \"Business Details -

formalise position descriptions and performance frameworks.  \n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n- Explore selected overseas sourcing partnerships to diversify product range and gain margin advantage.  \n- Automate and integrate tech stack for improved sync efficiency—consider cloud-based ERP or job-management tools.  \n- Expand in-house capabilities where feasible to reduce reliance on external contractors and improve quality control.  \n- Upskill and formalise the customer-service team to enhance retention and cross-sell services.  \n- Review and refine marketing strategy to focus on peak trading months (September–April) and measure campaign returns.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Building services\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Dennis Papworth\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"dennis@ehigroup.com.au\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0419445179\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"Director\",\n    \"Business Details - Please complete this table for each involved entity\": [\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"EHI Group\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Headquarter Business Address\": \"6\\/40 Bowman St Richmond NSW 2753\",\n    \"Business Email\": \"dennis@ehigroup.com.au\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"02 45786006\",\n    \"Business Website(s)\": \"www.ehigroup.com.au\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"JR Corporate Accountants\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"Michelle Robinson\",\n    \"Accountant Email\": \"michelle@jrcorporate.com.au\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"Install Curtains, security doors, shutters\",\n    \"Did you start the business?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"What was your turnover last financial year?\": \"$1,000,001 - $5,000,000\",\n    \"How many shareholders are there?\": \"2 \",\n    \"How many directors are there in total?\": \"2\",\n    \"Does your business require any licences in order to operate?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"Are your licences up to date?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"Is your business currently facing any legal actions?\": \"No\",\n    \"Are there any regulations that your business must comply with?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How many locations does your business operate out of?\": \"1-10\",\n    \"Does the business own any properties?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How many properties does the business lease?\": \"1\",\n    \"Please complete this for PROPERTY 1\": {\n        \"business_property_address\": \"6\\/40 Bowman St Richmond NSW 2753\",\n        \"premise_type\": \"Warehouse\",\n        \"lease_terms\": \"3 x 3\",\n        \"options\": \"3\",\n        \"current_term_expiry_date\": \"No expiry date\"\n    },\n    \"Do any of the properties (owned or leased) require any form of upgrade in the next 12 months (eg.

Executive summary</h2>\n    <p>\n      EHI Group, a single-warehouse building services business with two shareholders and AUD 1–5 million turnover, demonstrates solid legal, tax and bookkeeping foundations. Key gaps exist in strategic planning (no business plan), financial clarity (irregular report reviews, unmanaged debt) and operational resilience (owner dependency, ad hoc meetings, no succession plan). People and product areas require more regular performance reviews and product/service refresh, while branding lacks a formal style guide and CRM. Immediate focus on due diligence preparation and structured reporting will accelerate sale readiness.\n    </p>\n\n    <h2>2.

Segregate migration and education operations to clarify value drivers and streamline due diligence.  \n2. Upgrade or replace the CRM to achieve at least a 7/10 effectiveness rating and bolster repeat sales.  \n3. Eliminate the three-day WIP bottleneck to uphold service standards and protect reputation.  \n4. Complete a robust continuity plan ensuring the business can thrive without the founder’s day-to-day oversight.  \n\n**Key Takeaways**  \n• NPS of 80+ and deep customer relationships form a powerful moat – nurture it during transition.  \n• £1.4 million of education revenue is pre-committed at under £60K annual cost, a compelling income stream.  \n• Strong tech stack and AI initiatives already in play – leverage as a unique selling point.  \n• Marketing budget >£150K online yet ROI not tracked – clarity here will drive more efficient spend.  \n• Two distinct revenue engines require bespoke strategies for growth or disposal.  \n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n• Roll out the AI Voice Agent and assessment tools to reduce headcount costs and lift margins.  \n• Package the education arm’s locked-in revenue as a standalone asset to attract buyers.  \n• Migrate Salesforce data into Go High Level with automated lead nurturing to accelerate new client acquisition.  \n• Bolster the succession plan with operational manuals and trained deputies for the migration side.  \n• Implement robust marketing analytics to optimise spend and demonstrate clear ROI to stakeholders.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Educational services\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Shannon Semenikow\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"info@emsaus.com\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0402338284\",\n    \"Headquarter Business Address\": \"3 Marlin Court\",\n    \"Business Email\": \"info@emsaus.com\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"0402338284\",\n    \"Business Website(s)\": \"www.emsaus.com\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"Thomas and Noble\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"Brad Thom\",\n    \"Accountant Address\": \"Byron Bay\",\n    \"Accountant Phone\": \"02 6685 6529\",\n    \"Accountant Email\": \"brad.tom@tnrbyron.com.au\",\n    \"Why is the business for sale?\": \"Want change in life\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"Migration Strategy for corporate and individuals\",\n    \"Did you start the business?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How old is the business?\": 14,\n    \"What was your turnover last financial year?\": \"$1,000,001 - $5,000,000\",\n    \"What do you intend to do after selling the business?\": [\n        {\n            \"sellerName\": \"Shannon Semenikow\",\n            \"sellerIntent\": \"New career\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"What is the business structure?\": \"Compa y\",\n    \"How many shareholders are there?\": \"1\",\n    \"How many directors are there in total?\": \"1\",\n    \"Does your business require any licences in order to operate?\": \"No\",\n    \"Is your business currently facing any legal actions?\": \"No\",\n    \"Are there any regulations that your business must comply with?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"Please advise\": \"Migration Agent Code of Conduct\",\n    \"How many locations does your business operate out of?\": \"1-10\",\n    \"Does the business own any properties?\": \"No\",\n    \"How many properties does the business lease?\": \"3\",\n    \"Please complete this for PROPERTY 1\": {\n        \"business_property_address\": \"We Work 6 123 Queen Street Brisbane 4000\",\n        \"premise_type\": \"Shared office space\",\n        \"lease_terms\": \"1 year\"\n    },\n    \"Please complete this for PROPERTY 2\": {\n        \"business_property_address\": \"We Work 7 22 Spencer Street Melbourne\",\n        \"premise_type\": \"Shared office space\",\n        \"lease_terms\": \"1 year\"\n    },\n    \"Please complete this for PROPERTY 3\": {\n        \"business_property_address\": \"Room 808, Ayala Life FGU Center, Cebu Business Park.\",\n        \"premise_type\": \"Office\",\n        \"lease_terms\": \"1 year\"\n    },\n    \"Do any of the properties (owned or leased) require any form of upgrade in the next 12 months (eg.

Financial performance is profitable but hampered by irregular reporting and limited bookkeeping support. Operations and customer-facing processes are mature, yet there is some owner dependency and gaps in IT support. People management is sound overall, though key employee risks and under-performing staff require attention. Brand, legal, tax and compliance are well managed. A focused programme of tasks across financial clarity, people, due diligence and customer processes will optimise sale readiness.</p>\n\n    <h2>2.

Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>This programme of financial, operational, people and due-diligence tasks will significantly enhance the business’s sale readiness. We recommend initiating M1 and M4 tasks immediately, with phased roll-out of remaining modules over the next 90 days. A follow-up review should be scheduled in 60 days to track progress and adjust priorities.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>','2025-08-19 00:32:20','2025-09-02 00:06:32'),(19,23,3,17,'primary','completed','2025-08-19 23:09:55','2025-08-19 23:45:40',100,'**Critical Issues**  \n- Persistent net loss of $50–100K and declining profitability amid industry downturn.  \n- Heavy reliance on owner (70% dependency) with no effective succession plan in place.  \n- Inadequate licence compliance despite hefty fees and looming expiries.  \n- Under-resourced sales and marketing: no clear process, poor ROI tracking, low satisfaction rating (2/10).  \n- Weak team culture and skill shortages jeopardising operational consistency.  \n\n**High-Level Goals**  \n- Restore profitability through cost control, margin improvement and debt reduction.  \n- Develop and execute a structured sales and marketing plan with clear ROI metrics.  \n- Strengthen leadership bench-strength and implement a robust, proactive succession framework.  \n- Achieve full regulatory and licence compliance ahead of expiry dates.  \n\n**Key Takeaways**  \n- Crisis in culture: poor cohesion and retention threats demand immediate HR intervention.  \n- Sales dependency: top 3 customers account for 52% revenue—diversify to reduce concentration risk.  \n- Cash-flow strain is masked by financing; optimise working capital (stock, WIP and debtors).  \n- Technology and process re-engineering remain under-leveraged despite acceptable tech stack.  \n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n- Overhaul marketing: allocate budget to digital channels, refine targeting via CRM improvements.  \n- Culture uplift: introduce performance reviews, SLAs with outsourced services and team-building initiatives.  \n- Product/service innovation: capitalise on new materials and tech to differentiate margins.  \n- Process automation and re-engineering: reduce WIP over-hang and boost throughput.  \n- Supplier and pricing strategy: renegotiate terms to protect margins and mitigate buyer pressure.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Manufacturing and associated industries\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Stacey Meghins\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"stacey@manuco.com.au\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0456895487\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"Owner\",\n    \"Business Details -

business is 70% dependent on the owner.  \n- Weak team culture, chronic staffing shortages and no formal performance‐review process.  \n- Sales and marketing are underdeveloped: no articulated sales process, poor data tracking, dissatisfied with ROI.  \n\n**High-Level Goals**  \n- Return to profitability by Q4 2025 through cost control, pricing review and working-capital optimisation.  \n- Fully implement a robust succession plan to reduce key-person risk and enable business continuity without the owner.  \n- Build a high-performing team: recruit skilled staff, institute regular performance reviews and strengthen culture.  \n- Develop and execute a structured sales and marketing strategy: define process, track metrics and improve CRM usage.  \n\n**Key Takeaways**  \n- Dependence on one individual is a continuity hazard—delegate decision-making and document critical processes.  \n- Working capital is tied up in WIP ($856,900) and stock ($500,000); tightening stock levels and forward‐order management will free cash.  \n- The machinery and technical expertise are strengths—leverage these in marketing to differentiate on quality rather than price.  \n- Regular board or senior-management strategy reviews should be calendared rather than ad hoc, using documented agendas and action sheets.  \n- CRM effectiveness rated low; better utilisation will drive customer insights, retention and new-client growth (currently just 20% of sales).  \n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n- Optimise inventory and WIP: set firm minimums, improve job scheduling and accelerate invoicing.  \n- Formalise sales process and harness CRM for pipeline forecasting, segmentation and targeted campaigns.  \n- Invest in team culture: introduce clear role descriptions, training programmes and quarterly performance appraisals.  \n- Allocate marketing budget with measurable KPIs—test digital channels and track ROI to grow repeat and new‐customer sales.  \n- Review product/service portfolio in light of upcoming material and technology trends to stay ahead of overseas entrants.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Manufacturing and associated industries\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Stacey Meghins\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"stacey@manuco.com.au\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0456895487\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"Owner\",\n    \"Business Details - Please complete this table for each involved entity\": [\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"SMH Pty Ltd\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"Manuco\",\n            \"abn\": \"HMY Pty Ltd\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"HMY Pty Ltd\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"HMY Pty Ltd\",\n            \"abn\": \"45\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"Headquarter Business Address\": \"Unit 13, 23 square street, The Gap, QLD 4061\",\n    \"Please list all other office\\/location addresses\": [\n        {\n            \"addresses\": \"8 Gregsue Ct, The Gap, 4061\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Business Email\": \"admin@manuco.com.au\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"1300236456\",\n    \"Business Website(s)\": \"manuco.com.au\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"Forsyths\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"Bob Hope\",\n    \"Accountant Address\": \"3 Fosyths Street, Roma, QLD\",\n    \"Accountant Phone\": \"1200500500\",\n    \"Accountant Email\": \"bob@accountant.com\",\n    \"Why is the business for sale?\": \"Time to exit\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"we manufacture roofing products\",\n    \"Did you start the business?\": \"No\",\n    \"How did you acquire the business?\": \"Purchased\",\n    \"How many years have you had this business?\": 8,\n    \"How old is the business?\": 23,\n    \"What was your turnover last financial year?\": \"$500,001 - $1,000,000\",\n    \"What do you intend to do after selling the business?\": [\n        {\n            \"sellerName\": \"Stacy\",\n            \"sellerIntent\": \"Retire\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"What is the business structure?\": \"We are a trading company, owned by another entity\",\n    \"How many shareholders are there?\": \"5\",\n    \"How many directors are there in total?\": \"3\",\n    \"Does your business require any licences in order to operate?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"Please complete this table\": [\n        {\n            \"type\": \"Manuf Licence\",\n            \"expiry\": \"12\\/06\\/2025\",\n            \"cost\": \"$8000 \"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Are your licences up to date?\": \"No\",\n    \"Is your business currently facing any legal actions?\": \"No\",\n    \"Are there any regulations that your business must comply with?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"Please advise\": \"We have the building industry code to bear in mind\",\n    \"How many locations does your business operate out of?\": \"1-10\",\n    \"Does the business own any properties?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How many properties does the business lease?\": \"none\",\n    \"Do any of the properties (owned or leased) require any form of upgrade in the next 12 months (eg.

Return to profitability by recapturing lost customers and optimising cost structure.  \n2. Establish robust governance: settle legal actions, embed regulatory-compliance controls and engage dedicated financial expertise.  \n3. Build scalable systems: document core processes, adopt basic automation tools and digital reporting dashboards.  \n4. Reduce single-point risk: develop succession plan, delegate responsibilities, and formalise internal meetings and strategy reviews.  \n\n**Key Takeaways**  \n• Owner reliance is a vulnerability – invest in team training, clear job descriptions and hand-over protocols.  \n• Financial visibility drives decisions – appoint a bookkeeper, bring activity statements up to date and monitor weekly KPIs beyond bank statements.  \n• Untapped marketing potential – no CRM or data segmentation; defining a simple digital sales strategy could reignite new-customer growth.  \n• Working-capital blind spots – unknown WIP value and stock-turn metrics constrain cash flow; prioritise inventory controls.  \n• Informal HR practices – quarterly reviews exist, but lack performance-management framework; formalise recruitment, retention and underperformance protocols.  \n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n• Leverage property assets – consider using owned premises for light manufacturing or third-party storage to reduce lease expenses.  \n• Launch a basic e-commerce channel – extend reach beyond the café/retail store, vital for seasonal fluctuations (peak in December).  \n• Strengthen supplier partnerships – negotiate exclusivity or volume discounts to improve margins above industry average.  \n• Optimise stock and WIP levels – align stock with lowest manageable thresholds to free up capital and improve liquidity.  \n• Prepare for acquisition – solidify financial and operational fundamentals now to support Stacey’s intention to buy another business post-sale.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"Cafes and Restaurants\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Stacey Meghins\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"stacey@manuco.com.au\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"0456895487\",\n    \"Business Details - Please complete this table for each involved entity\": [\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"SMH Pty Ltd\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"Manuco\",\n            \"abn\": \"0265989\",\n            \"directors\": \"Stacey Meghins\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Headquarter Business Address\": \"Unit 13, 23 square street, The Gap, QLD 4061\",\n    \"Please list all other office\\/location addresses\": [\n        {\n            \"addresses\": \"8 Gregsue Ct, The Gap, 4061\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Business Email\": \"admin@manuco.com.au\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"1300236456\",\n    \"Business Website(s)\": \"www.manuco.com.au\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"Forsyths\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"Bob Hope\",\n    \"Accountant Address\": \"3 Fosyths Street, Roma, QLD\",\n    \"Accountant Phone\": \"1200500500\",\n    \"Accountant Email\": \"bob@accountant.com\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"We manufacture roofing products\",\n    \"Did you start the business?\": \"No\",\n    \"How did you acquire the business?\": \"Purchased\",\n    \"How many years have you had this business?\": 3,\n    \"How old is the business?\": 8,\n    \"What was your turnover last financial year?\": \"$5,000,001 - $10,000,000\",\n    \"What do you intend to do after selling the business?\": [\n        {\n            \"sellerName\": \"Stacey Meghins\",\n            \"sellerIntent\": \"Buy another business\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"What is the business structure?\": \"One director\",\n    \"How many shareholders are there?\": \"2\",\n    \"How many directors are there in total?\": \"1\",\n    \"Does your business require any licences in order to operate?\": \"No\",\n    \"Is your business currently facing any legal actions?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"Are there any regulations that your business must comply with?\": \"No\",\n    \"How many locations does your business operate out of?\": \"1-10\",\n    \"Does the business own any properties?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How many properties does the business lease?\": \"1\",\n    \"Please complete this for PROPERTY 1\": {\n        \"business_property_address\": \"8 Gregsue Ct\",\n        \"land_area\": \"Australia\",\n        \"premise_type\": \"Office\",\n        \"lease_terms\": \"5 years\"\n    },\n    \"Do any of the properties (owned or leased) require any form of upgrade in the next 12 months (eg.

leverage this for further automation.  \n• Regular strategic and marketing plan reviews (last updated one month ago) show commitment—ensure data-driven decision-making continues.  \n• Staff recruitment and retention are flagged; align HR metrics (absenteeism, leave) with proactive talent-management strategies.  \n• Customer concentration at 30 % (largest) and 50 % (top three) warrants diversification to safeguard revenue.\n\n**Top Opportunities**  \n• Process Automation & Documentation: Formalise procedures and introduce workflow automation to boost consistency and reduce bottlenecks.  \n• CRM Optimisation: Invest in training, customisation and integration of CRM to improve client relationships and uncover upsell potential.  \n• Customer Diversification: Target new market segments or geographies to dilute dependency on a few major clients.  \n• Premises & Culture Enhancement: Refurbish or relocate to a modern workspace to support staff satisfaction and aid recruitment.  \n• Marketing ROI Framework: Deploy tracking tools across all channels to measure and refine marketing spend effectiveness.','{\n    \"What industry are you in?\": \"other\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Name\": \"Ali Avais\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Personal Email\": \"ali.avais@nuclieos.com\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Mobile Phone\": \"12345678912\",\n    \"Primary Contact Person Role\\/Title\": \"CEO\",\n    \"Business Details - Please complete this table for each involved entity\": [\n        {\n            \"companyName\": \"Nuclieos\",\n            \"tradingName\": \"46-bytes\",\n            \"abn\": \"12345678912\",\n            \"directors\": \"2\"\n        },\n        []\n    ],\n    \"Headquarter Business Address\": \"Building 156P, Lahore\",\n    \"Business Email\": \"ali.avais@nuclieos.com\",\n    \"Business Phone\": \"12345678912\",\n    \"Business Website(s)\": \"nuclieos.com\",\n    \"Accountant Company Name\": \"Nuclieos\",\n    \"Accountant Contact Person\": \"Razzaq\",\n    \"Accountant Address\": \"Lahore\",\n    \"Accountant Phone\": \"12345678912\",\n    \"Accountant Email\": \"razzaq@nuclieos.com\",\n    \"Why is the business for sale?\": \"SaaS products\",\n    \"What does the business do?\": \"Provide AI Services to Users\",\n    \"Did you start the business?\": \"Yes\",\n    \"How old is the business?\": 5,\n    \"What was your turnover last financial year?\": \"$500,001 - $1,000,000\",\n    \"What is the business structure?\": \"Partnership\",\n    \"How many shareholders are there?\": \"4\",\n    \"How many directors are there in total?\": \"2\",\n    \"Does your business require any licences in order to operate?\": \"No\",\n    \"Is your business currently facing any legal actions?\": \"No\",\n    \"Are there any regulations that your business must comply with?\": \"No\",\n    \"How many locations does your business operate out of?\": \"1-10\",\n    \"Does the business own any properties?\": \"No\",\n    \"How many properties does the business lease?\": \"none\",\n    \"Do any of the properties (owned or leased) require any form of upgrade in the next 12 months (eg.

INSERT INTO `messages` VALUES (1,4,'assistant','Hi Laura,  \n\nWelcome back! Based on our recent diagnostic, here are the top three priorities to get Stepping Into Your Power sale-ready and set you up for scalable growth:\n\n1. M8 Due Diligence Preparation (Red – Rank 1)  \n   • Why: You don’t yet have a strategic business plan or centralised data-room.  \n   • Quick win: Create a secure folder structure for due diligence documents (financial, legal, operations, HR, IP).\n\n2. M4 People (Red – Rank 2)  \n   • Why: There are no formal HR policies, no staff register or key-employee designations.  \n   • Quick win: Compile a complete staff list (even if it’s just you and future hires) with roles, start dates and “key-employee” flags.\n\n3. M3 Owner Dependency & Operations (Red – Rank 3)  \n   • Why: The business runs entirely on your shoulders, with no documented processes.  \n   • Quick win: Document your daily and periodic duties, then map out simple standard operating procedures (SOPs).\n\nAll other modules (customer segmentation, legal docs, financial reporting, brand consistency and tax compliance) are Amber/Green and can follow once these reds are tackled.\n\nNext steps—what would you like to focus on first? For example:  \n– Drafting your due-diligence folder structure (I can share a template)  \n– Working through a basic SOP for your workshop delivery and 1:1 client process  \n– Building a “people register” that will grow as you bring on contractors or employees  \n\nLet me know which you’d prefer, or if you’d like to address more than one area in parallel. Once you choose, I’ll guide you through a simple, step-by-step plan.',NULL,NULL,'2025-05-26 21:51:59','2025-05-26 21:51:59'),(2,4,'user','Hey Trinity. You mention business plan as the first priority.

Why a strategic business plan sits at the top  \n  • Foundation for everything else: A clear plan defines your vision, goals, target markets, key offerings and growth strategy. Without that north-star, every other piece (processes, people, marketing) can drift off course.  \n  • Due diligence readiness: Buyers look first for evidence you know where you’re heading and how you’ll get there. A one-page plan or strategy summary anchors your data room and shows you’ve thought things through.  \n  • Enabler for reducing owner dependency: Once you’ve written down your strategy and objectives, it becomes much easier to document the processes and routines that support them—and then hand those over to someone else down the track.\n\n2. How owner dependency fits in  \n  • We rank “owner dependency & operations” highly because 100% reliance on you is a major risk for a buyer. But the very first step to solving that is knowing which processes align to which strategic objectives—hence the plan comes first.  \n  • With a plan in place, you can ask: “Which workshop steps, client-onboarding tasks or marketing activities can I delegate?” That directly feeds into your SOPs and handover materials.\n\n3. What about the “People” module when you have no staff?  \n  • Even as a sole operator, you can use that module to:  \n    – Document your own role, hours and key responsibilities (we call that a “people register”).  \n    – Sketch out future roles or contractor engagements you’ll need to hit your plan.  \n    – Flag “key roles” (e.g., workshop facilitator, client manager, marketing lead) so you know what to hire or contract next.\n\nNext steps  \n  • Would you like a simple template for a one-page strategic plan? We can break it into Vision, Objectives, Key Strategies and KPIs—easy to draft in 30–45 minutes.  \n  • Once that’s done, we can map your daily/periodic duties to each strategic pillar, which immediately reduces owner dependency and feeds directly into your SOPs.  \n\nWhich of those sounds most helpful to you right now?','{\"id\":\"chatcmpl-Bba2fLO9uGzSJZ5j6UJEHBSzObpel\",\"object\":\"chat.completion\",\"created\":1748296381,\"model\":\"o4-mini-2025-04-16\",\"choices\":[{\"index\":0,\"message\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"Good questions, Laura.

What is the PPSR?  \n   – The Personal Property Securities Register is Australia’s national online register of security interests in personal property (i.e. all assets other than land).  \n   – When you take finance over plant, machinery, vehicles, stock or receivables, you “perfect” your security interest by lodging a financing statement on the PPSR. That gives you priority over other creditors.  \n\n2. Why use it?  \n   – To check if an asset is already encumbered (so you don’t unknowingly buy or sell subject to another party’s security interest).  \n   – To perfect your own finance arrangements and protect your lending or lease arrangements.  \n   – To discharge or amend registrations when debts are repaid or equipment is sold.  \n\n3. How to access and search  \n   a. Go to https://www.ppsr.gov.au and create a user account.  \n   b. Under “Search the Register” you can:  \n      • Search by serial number or VIN (for vehicles/plant).  \n      • Search by debtor name or ABN to see all registrations against your business.  \n   c. Download or print search results for your files.  \n\n4. How to register (perfect) a security interest  \n   a. Select “Register a Financing Statement.”  \n   b. Enter:  \n      • Grantor (your business/entity name & ABN)  \n      • Secured party (the financier’s details)  \n      • Collateral description (e.g. “Chattel – Manufacturing Press Model X serial no. 12345”).  \n      • Duration (up to 7 years; renew if needed).  \n   c. Pay the modest registration fee (approx. $6–$8).  \n   d. Retain the registration number and an electronic copy of the financing statement.  \n\n5. How to amend or discharge  \n   – Once a loan is repaid or an asset sold, lodge a Financing Change Statement (Discharge) to remove the security interest.  \n   – This updates the register and clears the title for future dealings.  \n\n6.

Executive summary</h3>\n  <p>\n    Stepping Into Your Power Pty Ltd, led by Laura McIntosh, demonstrates strong compliance in tax (M7) and solid brand integrity (M6). However, critical deficiencies in due diligence preparation (M8), people and HR policies (M4), and owner dependency and operations (M3) pose significant sale-readiness risks. Amber-rated modules—customer/product quality (M5), legal compliance (M2) and financial reporting (M1)—also require targeted enhancements. Immediate focus on red modules will establish robust foundations, reduce risk and position the business for scalable growth and a successful exit.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>2.

Executive Summary</h2>\n    <p>\n      Toby Flanders’s premium coffee-bean roasting business demonstrates strong tax compliance (Module 7) and solid financial management (Module 1), underpinned by a cohesive team and sound HR policies (Module 4). The brand and digital assets are in place, but updates are overdue (Module 6). Key gaps are evident in legal documentation and property compliance (Module 2) and in customer, product and revenue quality measures (Module 5). Owner dependency and lack of documented processes (Module 3), absence of a strategic business plan (Module 8) and limited marketing infrastructure further impede sale readiness. Addressing these issues through targeted tasks will enhance buyer confidence and streamline the exit process.\n    </p>\n\n    <!-- Section 2 -->\n    <h2>2.

Executive summary</h2>\n    <p>\n      The diagnostic reveals strong compliance in tax and regulatory lodgements and a solid strategic plan. Major gaps exist in financial reporting cadence, debt management and owner dependency. HR processes are underdeveloped, with under-performing staff and no regular reviews. Product relevance, pricing and supplier agreements require optimisation. Brand assets and premises need refresh.

Some are scored 0-5 and map 1-to-1 to the eight modules below; others are informational only.\r\n- Lower score ⇒ larger gap ⇒ higher priority.\r\n- RAG thresholds Red < 2 | Amber ≥ 2 < 3.9 | Green ≥ 4.\r\n\r\n## SALE-READY MODULES\r\n\r\n{\r\n\"modules\": [\r\n\"M1 Financial Clarity & Reporting\",\r\n\"M2 Legal, Compliance & Property\",\r\n\"M3 Owner Dependency & Operations\",\r\n\"M4 People\",\r\n\"M5 Customer, Product & Revenue Quality\",\r\n\"M6 Brand, IP & Intangibles\",\r\n\"M7 Tax, Compliance & Regulatory\",\r\n\"M8 Due Diligence Preparation\"\r\n]\r\n}\r\n\r\n## ROADMAP\r\n\r\nhere\'s how to produce the data:\r\n• **clientSummary** – ± 40-word overview.    \r\n• **module** – M1-M8.    \r\n• **rag** – Red / Amber / Green.    \r\n• **score** – average (1 decimal).    \r\n• **rank** – 1 = highest priority (lowest score).    \r\n• **whyPriority** – ≤ 120 characters.    \r\n• **quickWins** – one immediate-action line.\r\n\r\nstore as \"roadmap\" array of objects\r\n\r\n{\r\n\"clientSummary\": \"\",\r\n\"roadmap\": {\r\n\"module\": \"\",\r\n\"rag\": \"\",\r\n\"score\": \"\",\r\n\"rank\": \"\",\r\n\"whyPriority\": \"\",\r\n\"quickWins\": \"\"\r\n} }\r\n\r\n## ADVISOR PERSONA\r\n\r\nExperienced Sale-Ready Business Advisor & licensed Australian Business Broker; hundreds of SME exits; knows buyer and due-diligence requirements.\r\n\r\n## VALIDATION\r\n\r\n1. Build an array called SCORED_ROWS containing every response that meets BOTH rules:\r\n    - its question-key exists in SCORING_MAP, and\r\n    - its answer matches one of that key’s `\"values\"` entries.    \r\n      (All other responses are informational.)\r\n    - fill json like this:\r\n      {\"scored_rows\": [{\"question\": \"q1\", \"response\": \"r1\", \"score\": 5, \"module\": \"M1\"}, {\"question\": \"q2\", \"response\": \"r2\", \"score\": 3, \"module\": \"M2\"}, ...]}\r\n    - Use the full question instead of the key name.\r\n    - Assert that the count of SCORED_ROWS for each module equals the number of keys in SCORING_MAP assigned to that module **minus** any for which the client didn’t answer or where answers fell\r\n      outside the map.\r\n\r\n2. For each module Mi, compute:    \r\n   • Sum1 = Σ scores of all rows in SCORED_ROWS where row.module = Mi    \r\n   • Count1 = number of such rows    \r\n   • Avg1 = (Sum1 ÷ Count1)  ← round to one decimal\r\n\r\n3. **Independently** re-iterate through SCORED_ROWS and recompute Sum2, Count2, Avg2 for every Mi.\r\n\r\n4. Cross-check:    \r\n   • If Count1 ≠ Count2 for any module → use Count2 and recompute Avg.    \r\n   • If |Sum1 – Sum2| > 0.001 for any module → use Sum2 and recompute Avg.    \r\n   • If |Avg1 – Avg2| > 0.01 for any module → override with Avg2.\r\n\r\n5. Assert that every question-key present in both (client responses ∩ SCORING_MAP) appears in SCORED_ROWS.    \r\n   • If any scored key was missed, add it, recompute Step 1–3, then continue.\r\n\r\n6. Only when **all** modules pass the checks above may Trinity:    \r\n   • build the roadmap table, and    \r\n   • draft the advisorReport (Sections 1-5).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## ERROR HANDLING\r\n\r\nIf a mandatory field is missing, return the following error:\r\n{\"error\": \"Missing required field: <fieldName>\"}\r\n\r\n## SCORE & RANK\r\n\r\n1. Parse Scoring Map.\r\n2. Map each client response to a score **only if**\r\n    - the question key exists in SCORING_MAP, **and**\r\n    - the response matches a value in that key’s `\"values\"` map. Otherwise treat as null / informational.\r\n3. Average per module = sum ÷ count of scored answers.\r\n4. Rank modules: lowest average = rank 1; ties alphabetical.\r\n5. Validate via the Validation step.\r\n6.
